## What is Deep Learning?

- **Definition:** 
  - Subset of machine learning using multi-layered neural networks
  - Capable of automatically learning hierarchical representations from data
  - Performs feature extraction and transformation automatically

- **Key Difference from Traditional ML:**
  - Traditional ML: Features manually engineered by domain experts
  - Deep Learning: Features learned automatically from raw data
  - End-to-end learning without explicit feature engineering

## How Deep Learning Works

- **Core Components:**
  - **Neurons:** Basic computing units that process input signals
  - **Layers:** Groups of neurons that transform data representations
  - **Weights:** Parameters that are learned during training
  - **Activation Functions:** Non-linear transformations enabling complex patterns
  - **Loss Functions:** Measure how well the model is performing

- **Learning Process:**
  1. Forward pass: Data flows through the network
  2. Loss calculation: Compare predictions with actual values
  3. Backward pass: Update weights to reduce errors
  4. Repeat until convergence

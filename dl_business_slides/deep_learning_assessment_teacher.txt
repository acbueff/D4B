    "\n",
    "#### Key Improvements in the Enhanced Model:\n",
    "1. **Architectural changes**:\n",
    "   - Added an additional layer (4 layers vs 3) for more expressiveness\n",
    "   - Increased neurons in early layers (32 → 16 → 8 → 1 vs 16 → 8 → 1)\n",
    "   - Added dropout (20%) for regularization\n",
    "   - Implemented batch normalization to stabilize training\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training adjustments**:\n",
    "   - Reduced learning rate from 0.01 to 0.005 for finer convergence\n",
    "   - Increased training epochs from 100 to 150 for more learning opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Business Impact**:\n",
    "   - Improved F1 score from ~0.57 to >0.80\n",
    "   - Enhanced churn detection rate (more churners correctly identified)\n",
    "   - Better balance between precision and recall (fewer false positives and false negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Deployment in Production:\n",
    "1. Export the model using `torch.save()`\n",
    "2. Create API endpoints for real-time predictions\n",
    "3. Implement monitoring for model drift and performance\n",
    "4. Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement\n",
    "5. Set up A/B testing for retention strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Data for Improved Effectiveness:\n",
    "1. Customer support interaction logs (sentiment, resolution time)\n",
    "2. Detailed product usage patterns (features used, usage frequency)\n",
    "3. Competitors' pricing and promotion data\n",
    "4. Customer demographics and firmographics\n",
    "5. Market conditions and economic indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROI Calculation Framework:\n",
    "- **Costs**: Model development, infrastructure, retention offers\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Customer LTV × retention rate improvement\n",
    "- **Formula**: ROI = [(Retained customers × Average LTV) - Cost of retention offers - Implementation costs] / Implementation costs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "1. Data privacy and GDPR compliance\n",
    "2. Algorithmic bias and fairness across customer segments\n",
    "3. Transparency in how predictions are used\n",
    "4. Customer consent for data usage\n",
    "5. Balance between corporate interests and customer agency"

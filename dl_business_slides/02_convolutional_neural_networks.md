# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

---

## Introduction to CNNs

- **Definition:** Neural networks specialized for processing grid-like data (images)

- **Key Innovations:**
  - **Local Connectivity:** Neurons connect to small regions of input
  - **Parameter Sharing:** Same filter applied across entire image
  - **Pooling:** Downsampling to reduce dimensions
  - **Hierarchical Feature Learning:** Low-level to high-level features

- **Business Impact:**
  - Automated visual inspection and quality control
  - Medical image diagnosis
  - Document processing and analysis
  - Advanced recommendation systems

---

## Core Components of CNNs

- **Convolutional Layers:**
  - Apply filters to detect features (edges, textures, etc.)
  - Extract spatial patterns and create feature maps
  - Preserve spatial relationships in data

- **Pooling Layers:**
  - Reduce spatial dimensions (downsampling)
  - Provide translation invariance
  - Common types: Max pooling, average pooling

- **Fully Connected Layers:**
  - Final layers for classification or regression
  - Connect all neurons between layers
  - Similar to traditional neural networks

## Understanding Convolution Operations

- **Filter/Kernel:** Small matrix of weights (e.g., 3x3, 5x5)
- **Stride:** Step size when sliding filter across input
- **Padding:** Adding border pixels to maintain dimensions
- **Operation:** Element-wise multiplication and summation

**Business Analogy:** Scanning documents for key information with a template

## Comparison: CNN vs. Fully Connected Networks

| Aspect | Fully Connected NN | CNN |
|--------|-------------------|-----|
| **Parameters** | Many (scales with input size) | Fewer (shared filters) |
| **Spatial Awareness** | None | Preserves spatial relationships |
| **Translation Invariance** | Poor | Good (through pooling) |
| **Training Data Needs** | Higher | Lower |
| **Computational Efficiency** | Lower | Higher |
| **Business Applications** | Tabular data | Images, spatial data |

    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        # Convolutional layers
        self.conv_layers = nn.Sequential(
            # First conv block: 3 input channels (RGB), 16 output channels
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            
            # Second conv block: 16 input channels, 32 output channels
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=16, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        )
        
        # Fully connected layers for classification
        self.fc_layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(32 * 56 * 56, 128),  # Assuming input was 224x224
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(128, 10)  # 10 classes
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv_layers(x)
        x = self.fc_layers(x)
        return x
```

- **Early Layers:** Detect simple features
  - Edges, corners, color gradients

- **Middle Layers:** Combine simple features
  - Textures, patterns, basic shapes

- **Deep Layers:** Recognize complex objects
  - Faces, objects, scene elements

- **Business Application:**
  - Automatic feature engineering for complex visual data

## Transfer Learning with CNNs

- **Popular Pre-trained Models:**
  - ResNet, VGG, Inception, EfficientNet

- **Transfer Learning Process:**
  1. Select pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50)

  3. Add new layers specific to business problem
  4. Train only new layers or fine-tune selectively

- **Business Advantage:**
  - Leverage millions of images from ImageNet
  - Achieve high accuracy with limited training data
  - Faster development and deployment

## Transfer Learning Example

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

# Load pre-trained ResNet model
pretrained_model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Freeze early layers to retain learned features
for param in pretrained_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
    
# Replace final layer with a new one for our specific task
num_features = pretrained_model.fc.in_features
num_classes = 4  # Example: 4 product quality categories
pretrained_model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)

# Now only train the final layer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(pretrained_model.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

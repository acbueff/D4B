# Deep Learning Assessment: Customer Churn Prediction (TEACHER VERSION)

This notebook demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to predict customer churn. It includes a complete implementation with base and improved models, along with all solutions.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how to structure data for deep learning
2. Build and train a neural network using PyTorch
3. Evaluate model performance on business metrics
4. Implement improvements to a baseline model

## Assessment Criteria
To pass this assessment, your model must achieve:
- Test accuracy > 85% on the holdout set
- F1 score > 0.80 for the churn class

### MARKDOWN CELL
## Reflection Questions

Before coding, students should consider:
- What factors contribute most to customer churn?
- How to quantify the business cost of false negatives vs false positives?
- Why a high accuracy model might still perform poorly in a business context?

**Expected answers:**
- Customer churn factors: price sensitivity, service quality, competitive offers, usage patterns
- False negatives (missing churners) typically cost more than false positives (retention efforts)
- High accuracy can be misleading with imbalanced data, as a model could achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class

## 1. Data Generation and Feature Engineering

Real-world businesses collect numerous data points about their customers. For this assessment, we use synthetic data with features that typically influence churn:

- **Tenure**: How long the customer has been with the company
- **Monthly Charges**: How much the customer pays each month
- **Total Charges**: Cumulative amount paid over the customer's lifetime
- **Support Calls**: Number of calls to customer support
- **Usage Score**: How actively the customer uses the service/product

## 2. Data Visualization and Pattern Recognition

Before building a model, it's essential to explore the data to understand patterns and relationships.

#### Reflection Questions:
- What patterns do you observe in the visualizations?
- How might these patterns inform business strategies?
- Why is data exploration an important step before modeling?

**Expected answers:**
- Patterns: Higher churn for high monthly charges, lower tenure, more support calls
- Business strategies: Consider loyalty programs for newer customers, review pricing for high monthly charges
- Data exploration helps identify important features and potential data issues before modeling

## 3. Neural Network Architecture

Now we'll build a neural network to predict customer churn.

#### Reflection Questions:
- Why do we need non-linear activation functions?
- How does the network architecture relate to the complexity of patterns it can learn?
- What would happen if we used a linear model instead?

**Expected answers:**
- Non-linear activations allow the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships
- Deeper networks with more neurons can capture more complex patterns
- Linear models can only learn linear relationships, limiting their expressiveness

### CODE CELL
class ChurnPredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=5):
        super(ChurnPredictor, self).__init__()

        x = self.relu(self.layer1(x))  # ReLU helps with vanishing gradient
        x = self.relu(self.layer2(x))  # Multiple layers capture complex patterns
        x = self.sigmoid(self.layer3(x))  # Sigmoid squashes output to [0,1]
        return x

# Initialize the model
model = ChurnPredictor()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

print("Model architecture:")
print(model)

### MARKDOWN CELL
## 4. Model Training

During training, the model learns to minimize the loss function through backpropagation and gradient descent.

#### Reflection Questions:
- Why do we use both training and test sets?
- What patterns in the learning curves might suggest overfitting?
- How does backpropagation work to update the model's weights?

**Expected answers:**
- Training/test split helps evaluate generalization to unseen data
- Decreasing training loss but increasing test loss indicates overfitting
- Backpropagation calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to weights using the chain rule

## 5. Visualizing Training Progress

Visualizing the training process helps understand how the model learns over time.

#### Reflection Questions:
- What does the convergence of the loss curve tell us?
- How do we know if we've trained for enough epochs?
- Why might accuracy and F1 score evolve differently?

**Expected answers:**
- Convergence suggests the model is approaching a local/global minimum
- We've trained enough when validation metrics plateau or begin to degrade
- Accuracy and F1 differ because F1 considers class imbalance, while accuracy doesn't

## 6. Model Evaluation

Now we'll evaluate the model's performance on the test set using several metrics.

#### Reflection Questions:
- Which metric is most important for our business case?
- How do these metrics translate to business value?
- Why might high accuracy be misleading for imbalanced datasets?

**Expected answers:**
- F1 score is most important for churn as it balances precision and recall
- Better metrics translate to more efficient retention campaigns and cost savings
- High accuracy can hide poor minority class performance in imbalanced datasets

## 7. Improved Model Implementation (SOLUTION)

The base model may achieve high accuracy but fail the F1 score criterion due to class imbalance. We'll improve it by:
1. Adding more layers and neurons
2. Adding dropout for regularization
3. Implementing batch normalization
4. Adjusting the learning rate
5. Training for more epochs

#### Reflection Questions:
- How does dropout help prevent overfitting?
- Why use different layer sizes in the architecture?
- How do batch normalization and regularization affect model training?

**Expected answers:**
- Dropout prevents co-adaptation by randomly deactivating neurons during training
- Layer sizes typically decrease from input to output, creating a funnel to extract meaningful features
- Batch normalization stabilizes training and allows higher learning rates, while regularization prevents overfitting

## 8. Reflection and Business Analysis

#### Key Improvements in the Enhanced Model:
1. **Architectural changes**:
   - Added an additional layer for more expressiveness
   - Increased neurons in early layers (32 → 16 → 8 → 1)
   - Added dropout (20%) for regularization
   - Implemented batch normalization to stabilize training

2. **Training adjustments**:
   - Reduced learning rate from 0.01 to 0.005
   - Increased training epochs from 100 to 150

3. **Business Impact**:
   - Improved F1 score from ~0.57 to >0.80
   - Enhanced churn detection rate
   - Better balance between precision and recall

#### Implementing in Production:
1. Export the model using torch.save()
2. Create API endpoints for real-time predictions
3. Implement monitoring systems for model drift
4. Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement

#### Additional Data for Improved Effectiveness:
1. Customer support interaction logs
2. Product usage patterns
3. Competitors' pricing data
4. Market conditions
5. Promotional and marketing touch points

#### ROI Calculation:
- **Cost of retention offers**: $X per customer
- **Value of retained customer**: Average LTV of $Y
- **Customer acquisition cost**: $Z per new customer
- **ROI = [(Number of correctly identified churners × Retention success rate × LTV) - (Number of retention offers × Cost per offer)] / Cost of implementing the system**

#### Ethical Considerations:
1. Data privacy and GDPR compliance
2. Algorithmic bias and fairness across customer segments
3. Transparency in how predictions inform customer treatment
4. Consent for data usage in modeling

       "In this notebook, we've explored how Named Entity Recognition and rule-based extraction can automatically analyze legal contracts, similar to JPMorgan's COIN system. We've demonstrated:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Using pre-trained NER to identify people, organizations, dates, and monetary amounts\n",
       "2. Extracting specific loan details using a combination of NER and regex\n",
       "3. Creating custom patterns to identify contract-specific clauses\n",
       "4. Analyzing document structure to understand the organization of a contract\n",
       "\n",
       "These techniques form the foundation of automated contract analysis systems that save time, reduce errors, and enable large-scale contract processing that would be impossible to do manually.\n",
       "\n",
       "While our demonstration used simplified examples, the same principles apply to sophisticated systems processing thousands of complex legal documents. By combining machine learning with domain expertise, organizations can transform unstructured contract text into structured, actionable business intelligence."

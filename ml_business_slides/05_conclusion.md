# Workshop Conclusion

## Key Takeaways

### Business Impact of ML/NLP
- Sentiment Analysis → Customer insights and product improvement
- Named Entity Recognition → Automation of document processing
- Machine Translation → Expanding market reach globally

### Implementation Considerations
- Balance between off-the-shelf solutions and custom models
- Data quality is critical for model performance
- Start small with focused use cases before scaling
- Consider ethics and privacy in ML applications

### Next Steps for Your Organization

1. **Identify Opportunities**
   - Where are your text-heavy processes?
   - What patterns are humans currently finding manually?
   - Which global markets could you reach with better translation?

2. **Start with Proof of Concept**
   - Apply these techniques to a small dataset
   - Measure potential time/cost savings
   - Refine before full-scale implementation

3. **Build or Buy Decision**
   - Cloud APIs vs. custom solutions
   - Consider expertise needed for maintenance
   - Evaluate TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)

## Resources for Further Learning

- **Hands-on Practice:**
  - Google Colab notebooks (no installation required)
  - Hugging Face model exploration
  - Kaggle competitions and datasets

- **Business Case Studies:**
  - Stanford's "AI Index Report"
  - Industry-specific ML application papers
  - Case studies from cloud ML providers

What is intelligence?
• Legg and Hutter made a survey of 71 different definitions of
intelligence in 2007.

• Commonly occurring features:
• Is a property that an individual agent has as it interacts with its
• environment or environments.

• Is related to the agent’s ability to succeed or profit with respect to
• some goal or objective.
• Depends on how able the agent is to adapt to different objectives
and

• environments
• Based on this, they came up with: “Intelligence measures an
agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of
environments.”

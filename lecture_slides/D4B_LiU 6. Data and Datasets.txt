Basic Terminology

Most Basic Terminology
Data: known facts that can be recorded
and that have implicit meaning
Database: collection of related data (logically coherent)
• Represents some aspects of the real world (miniworld)
• Built for a specific purpose
Examples of large databases
• Amazon.com's product data
• Data collection underlying Webreg

Terminology (cont'd)
Database management system (DBMS)
• Collection of computer programs
• Enables users to create and maintain a database (DB)
• Supports concurrent access to a database by multiple users
and programs
• Protects the DB against unauthorized access and
manipulation
• Provides means to evolve the DB as requirements change
Examples of database management systems

• IBM’s DB2, Microsoft’s Access, Microsoft’s SQL Server,
Oracle, SAP’s SQL Anywhere, MySQL, PostgreSQL

The Database Approach

Pre-DBMS Data Management
Used traditional file processing
• Each user defines and implements the files
needed for a specific software application

As the application base grows
• many shared files
• a multitude of file structures
• a need to exchange data among applications

Problems of Pre-DBMS Data Management

Redundancy: multiple copies
Inconsistency: independent updates
Inaccuracy: concurrent updates

Incompatibility: multiple formats
Insecurity: proliferation
Inauditability: poor chain of responsibility
Inflexibility: changes are

Database Approach
Eventually recognized that data is a critical corporate
asset (along with capital and personnel)
• Need to manage the data in a more systematic manner

Database approach: Use a single repository to maintain
data that is defined once and accessed by various users
• Addresses the
aforementioned problems

Characteristics of the Database Approach
Programs isolated from data through abstraction
• DBMS does not expose details of how (or where) data is
stored or how operations are implemented
• Programs refer to an abstract model of the data, rather
than data storage details
• Data structures and storage organization can be changed
without having to change the application programs
Support of multiple views of the data
• Different users may see different views of the database,which
contain only the data of interest to these users
Multi-user transaction processing
• Encapsulates sequence of operations to behave atomically
● e.g., transferring funds

Characteristics of the Database Approach
Data is self-describing

• Database system contains a database catalog with meta-data
that describes structure and constraints of the database(s)
• Database catalog used by DBMS, and by DB users who need
information about DB structure
• Example:

Using a Database System

Defining a Database
Specifying the data types, structures, and constraints
of the data to be stored
Uses a Data Definition Language (DDL)

Meta-data: Database definition or descriptive information
• Stored by the DBMS in a database catalog or data dictionary
Phases for designing a database:
• Requirements specification and analysis
• Conceptual design
• e.g., using the Entity-Relationship model

• Logical design
• e.g., using the relational model

• Physical design

Database System Design Process
Two main activities:
• Database design
focuses on defining
the database
• Application design
focuses on the
programs and
interfaces that
access the
database
(out of scope
of this lecture)

Example of Data Requirements
A taxi company needs to model their activities.
There are two types of employees in the company: drivers
and operators. For drivers it is interesting to know the date
of issue and type of the driving license, and the date of
issue of the taxi driver’s certificate. For all employees it is
interesting to know their personal number, address and the
available phone numbers.
The company owns a number of cars. For each car there is
a need to know its type, year of manufacturing, number of
places in the car and date of the last service.
The company wants to have a record of car trips. A taxi
may be picked on a street or ordered through an operator
who assigns the order to a certain driver and a car.
Departure and destination addresses together with times
should also be recorded.

Another Example
Movie database: information concerning movies, actors, awards
Data records

• Film
• Person
• Role
• Honors
Define structure of each type of data record by specifying
data elements to include and data type for each element
• String (sequence of alphabetic characters)
• Numeric (integer or real)
• Date (year or year-month-day)
• Monetary amount

Using a Database (cont'd)
Populating a DB: Inserting data to reflect the miniworld
Query: Interaction causing some data to be retrieved
• Uses a Query Language
Examples of queries:
• List the cast of characters for Lincoln.
• Who directed a drama in 2012?
• Who directed a film in which he or she also played a role?
• What awards were won by War Horse?

20

Using a Database (cont'd)
Populating a DB: Inserting data to reflect the miniworld
Query: Interaction causing some data to be retrieved
• Uses a Query Language
Manipulating a DB
• Querying and updating the DB to understand/reflect miniworld
• Generating reports
• Uses a Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Examples of updates:
• Record that Argo won a Golden Globe award for best picture.
• Add another $395,533 to the gross earnings for Lincoln.
• Change the birthplace for Daniel Day-Lewis to London.
• Delete all data about the movie Fire Sale from the database.

Using a Database (cont'd)

• Uses a Query Language
Manipulating a DB
• Querying and updating the DB to understand/reflect miniworld
• Generating reports
• Uses a Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Application program
• Accesses DB by sending queries and updates to DBMS

22

Reorganizing a Database
Changes the metadata rather than the data
More drastic than data updates
• May require massive changes to the data
• May require changes to some application programs
Uses the Data Definition Language (DDL) again
Examples:
• Move director from FILM to a separate relation
DIRECTOR with columns for person and movie
• Change birth from yyyy to yyyy/mm/dd
• Split name in PERSON to separate surname from given names.
• Include data element movieID in FILM (to accommodate remakes
and other duplications of film title); update other relations
accordingly

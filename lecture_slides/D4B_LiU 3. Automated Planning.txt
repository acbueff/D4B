Automated Planning

What is Automated Planning?
• ⇝ finding plans (sequences of actions)
• that lead from an initial state to a goal state
• Here: classical planning

• general approach to finding
solutions for state-space search
problems

• classical = static, deterministic, fully
observable

• variants: probabilistic planning, planning
under partial observability, online planning, . . .

“Planning is the
art and practice
of thinking
before acting.”
• P. Haslum

Planning: Informally
given:
• state space description in terms of suitable problem
description language (planning formalism)

required:
• a plan, i.e., a solution for the described state space
(sequence of actions from initial state to goal)
• or a proof that no plan exists

distinguish between
• optimal planning: guarantee that returned plans are
optimal, i.e., have minimal overall cost
• suboptimal planning (satisficing): suboptimal plans
are allowed

What is New?
Many previously encountered problems are planning tasks:
blocks world
route planning in romania missionaries and cannibals 15puzzle
New: we are now interested in general algorithms, i.e., the
developer of the search algorithm does not know the tasks
that the algorithm needs to solve.
⇝ no problem-specific heuristics!
⇝ input language to model the planning task

State Space

(action names omitted; initial
state and goal can be
arbitrary)

• state spaces are (labeled, directed) graphs
• terminology: predecessor, successor, applicable action,
path, length, costs, reachable, solution, optimal solution

State Spaces with Declarative Representations
How do we represent state spaces in the computer?
previously: as black box
now: as declarative description

represent state spaces declaratively:
• compact description of state space as input to algorithms
⇝ state spaces exponentially larger than the input
• algorithms directly operate on compact description
⇝ allows automatic reasoning about problem: reformulation,
simplification, abstraction, etc.

Compact Description of State Spaces
How to describe state spaces compactly?
Compact Description of Several States

• introduce state variables
• states: assignments to state variables
⇝ e.g., n binary state variables can describe 2n states

• transitions and goal are compactly described with a logic-based formalism
⇝ different variants: different planning formalisms

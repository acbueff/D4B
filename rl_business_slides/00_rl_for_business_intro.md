# Reinforcement Learning Applications in Business: Introduction

---

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

- **Definition:** 
  - Machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment
  - Agent learns to map situations (states) to actions to maximize numerical rewards
  - Learning through trial-and-error with delayed feedback

- **Key Difference from Other ML Approaches:**
  - Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled examples
  - Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
  - Reinforcement Learning: Learning from interaction and feedback

## How Reinforcement Learning Works

- **Core Components:**
  - **Agent:** The decision-maker that learns and acts
  - **Environment:** The world the agent interacts with
  - **State:** The current situation the agent observes
  - **Action:** The choices the agent can make
  - **Reward:** Feedback signal indicating success/failure
  - **Policy:** The agent's strategy for selecting actions

- **Learning Process:**
  1. Agent observes current state
  2. Agent selects and performs an action
  3. Environment transitions to a new state
  4. Agent receives a reward
  5. Agent updates its understanding based on experience

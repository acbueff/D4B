# Q-Learning and Value Functions

---

## Value Functions: The Foundation

- **State-Value Function:** V(s)
  - Expected cumulative future reward starting from state s
  - V<sup>π</sup>(s) = E<sub>π</sub> [R<sub>t+1</sub> + γR<sub>t+2</sub> + γ<sup>2</sup>R<sub>t+3</sub> + ... | S<sub>t</sub> = s]

- **Action-Value Function:** Q(s, a)
  - Expected cumulative future reward of taking action a in state s
  - Q<sup>π</sup>(s, a) = E<sub>π</sub> [R<sub>t+1</sub> + γR<sub>t+2</sub> + γ<sup>2</sup>R<sub>t+3</sub> + ... | S<sub>t</sub> = s, A<sub>t</sub> = a]

- **Business Interpretation:**
  - V(s): Long-term value of having a customer in a particular segment
  - Q(s, a): Long-term value of taking a specific marketing action with a customer segment

---

## Optimal Value Functions

- **Optimal State-Value Function:** V*(s)
  - Maximum possible expected return achievable from state s
  - V*(s) = max<sub>π</sub> V<sup>π</sup>(s)

- **Optimal Action-Value Function:** Q*(s, a)
  - Maximum expected return taking action a from state s
  - Q*(s, a) = max<sub>π</sub> Q<sup>π</sup>(s, a)

- **Bellman Optimality Equations:**
  - V*(s) = max<sub>a</sub> [R(s, a) + γ∑<sub>s'</sub>P(s'|s, a)V*(s')]
  - Q*(s, a) = R(s, a) + γ∑<sub>s'</sub>P(s'|s, a)max<sub>a'</sub>Q*(s', a')

---

## From Values to Policies

- **Extracting Policy from Value Function:**
  - π*(s) = argmax<sub>a</sub> Q*(s, a)

- **Business Decision-Making:**
  - Once Q-values are learned, decision-making becomes straightforward
  - For each customer/situation, select the action with highest Q-value

- **Example: Pricing Strategy**
  - State: Current inventory level, time of year, competitor prices
  - Q-value: Long-term profit expectation for each price point
  - Policy: Set price to maximize long-term profit (highest Q-value)

## Introduction to Q-Learning

- **Model-Free Learning:** Learn optimal Q-values directly from experience
  - No need to know transition probabilities or rewards in advance
  - Learn through trial-and-error interaction with environment

- **Q-Learning Update Rule:**
  - Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α [r + γ max<sub>a'</sub> Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
  - α: Learning rate (0-1)
  - r: Immediate reward
  - γ: Discount factor
  - max<sub>a'</sub> Q(s', a'): Estimated optimal future value

- **Convergence Guarantee:**
  - Q-values will converge to Q* given sufficient exploration
  - "Sufficient exploration" is a key practical challenge

## Q-Learning in Practice

```python
# Q-learning for customer journey optimization
def q_learning(env, num_episodes=1000, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.1):
    # Initialize Q-table: All state-action pairs set to zero
    num_states = 5  # Customer journey stages
    num_actions = 2  # Marketing actions
    Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))
    
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        
        while not done:
            # Epsilon-greedy action selection
            if np.random.random() < epsilon:
                action = np.random.choice(num_actions)  # Explore
            else:
                action = np.argmax(Q[state])  # Exploit
            
            # Take action and observe result
            next_state, reward = env.step(action)
            
            # Q-learning update
            best_next_action = np.argmax(Q[next_state])
            td_target = reward + gamma * Q[next_state, best_next_action]
            td_error = td_target - Q[state, action]
            Q[state, action] += alpha * td_error
            
            state = next_state
            done = (state == 4)  # Terminal state (loyal customer)
    
    return Q
```

## Q-Table Example: Marketing Campaign Optimization

- **Q-Table for Customer Segments:**

|                  | Generic Email | Personalized Offer | Discount Coupon |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **New Visitor**  | 2.1           | 4.5               | 3.2             |
| **Browsed Only** | 1.8           | 5.7               | 6.3             |
| **Cart Abandon** | 0.9           | 4.1               | 8.6             |
| **Past Customer**| 3.6           | 7.2               | 5.4             |

- **Business Interpretation:**
  - For "Cart Abandon" segment, "Discount Coupon" has highest Q-value (8.6)
  - For "Past Customer" segment, "Personalized Offer" is optimal (7.2)
  - Values represent expected long-term value (not just immediate conversion)

## Exploration vs. Exploitation

- **Exploitation:** Choose action with highest known value
  - Maximize immediate performance
  - May miss better alternatives

- **Exploration:** Try different actions to gather information
  - Discover potentially better strategies
  - Sacrifice short-term performance for knowledge

- **Business Dilemma:**
  - Marketing: Test new campaigns vs. use proven campaigns
  - Product: Refine existing features vs. develop new ones
  - Investment: Established markets vs. emerging opportunities

- **Common Strategies:**
  - ε-greedy: Choose best action with probability (1-ε), random with probability ε
  - Softmax/Boltzmann: Probabilistic selection weighted by estimated values
  - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): Balance value estimates with uncertainty

---

## Q-Learning for Business: Practical Considerations

- **State Representation:**
  - Include relevant customer/business attributes
  - Balance detail with generalization
  - Example: Customer segments vs. individual customer profiles

- **Reward Design:**
  - Align with business objectives
  - Consider immediate and delayed outcomes
  - Example: Balance conversion rate vs. customer lifetime value

- **Learning Parameters:**
  - Learning rate (α): How quickly to incorporate new information
  - Exploration rate (ε): How often to try new strategies
  - Discount factor (γ): How much to value future rewards

---

## Business Applications of Q-Learning

- **Digital Marketing Optimization:**
  - States: Customer segments, demographics, behavior
  - Actions: Campaign types, messaging, timing
  - Rewards: Clicks, conversions, revenue

- **Dynamic Pricing:**
  - States: Inventory levels, demand patterns, competitor prices
  - Actions: Price points, discount levels
  - Rewards: Profit, market share, inventory reduction

- **Customer Service Routing:**
  - States: Query types, customer value, agent availability
  - Actions: Routing decisions, escalation levels
  - Rewards: Resolution speed, customer satisfaction, cost efficiency

---

## Deep Q-Learning for Complex Business Problems

- **Limitation of Tabular Q-Learning:**
  - Cannot handle large or continuous state spaces
  - Many business problems have complex state representations

- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):**
  - Use neural networks to approximate Q-function
  - Can handle high-dimensional state spaces
  - Enable more nuanced representations of customers/situations

- **Business Applications:**
  - Personalization based on rich customer data
  - Recommendation systems with complex item features
  - Financial trading with numerous market indicators

---

## Implementation Example: DQN

```python
# Simplified DQN architecture
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, action_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# State could include customer features:
# - Recency of last purchase
# - Frequency of purchases
# - Monetary value of purchases
# - Demographics
# - Website behavior
```

## Learning Challenge: Marketing Campaign Q-Values

**Exercise:** Consider the following Q-table for marketing campaign optimization:

| Customer Segment | Email | Social Ad | Discount | Loyalty Offer |
|------------------|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| New Visitor      | 2.1   | 4.3       | 3.8      | 1.2           |
| One-time Buyer   | 3.4   | 2.7       | 6.5      | 4.1           |
| Frequent Buyer   | 4.2   | 3.1       | 2.8      | 7.6           |
| At-risk          | 1.9   | 2.2       | 8.3      | 5.5           |

**Questions:**
1. What marketing action would you take for each customer segment?
2. How would you interpret the Q-values for the "At-risk" segment?
3. If you use ε-greedy with ε=0.1, what is the probability of choosing each action for "Frequent Buyer"?

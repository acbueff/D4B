## Teaching Methodology

Each lecture follows a consistent structure:
1. Introduction to the RL concept and its business relevance
2. Explanation of how the technique works
3. Code examples and implementation approaches
4. Business applications and case studies
5. Learning challenges for hands-on experimentation

Slides are complemented by interactive Jupyter notebooks that allow students to experiment with the techniques directly.

## Customization Notes

The slides are designed to be modular, allowing instructors to:
- Adjust technical depth based on audience background
- Add company-specific examples when relevant
- Expand learning challenges for more technical audiences
- Update with current RL developments and tools
